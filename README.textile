This project is a mirror of the official MacroMates bundle repository with
filenames munged to be legal under windows. Many of these bundles (especially
their commands) will *not* work as-is under Windows with e.

For bundles that have been ported to run correctly under the e-texteditor on
Windows, please see the e-bundles repository on
"GitHub":http://github.com/gtcaz/ebundles/tree/master or "Google
Code":http://code.google.com/p/ebundles/ (svn).
